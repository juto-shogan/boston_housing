# Boston Housing Price Prediction

A machine learning project analysing and predicting housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset.

## Overview

This project implements various regression models, including:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Polynomial Regression with cross-validation and feature engineering.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:
